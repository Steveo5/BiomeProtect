# BiomeProtect

## Synopsis

BiomeProtect is a region protection plugin for bukkit servers. It allows players to place configurable 'protection stones' aka
blocks that have been configured as such and have it owned by only them. Right clicking the placed stone will show a menu where
players can whitelist players, change flags to fully customize their experience.

## Code Example

BiomeProtect will have an event api but right now it's still in the making
## Motivation

I own a vanilla minecraft server and needed a way for players to create self served protection while my admins/mods are offline.
This allows them to do just that by pruchasing them in-game (or giving them away).
## Installation

Place the BiomeProtect.jar inside your plugins folder and check the logs to see if its working
## Contributors

At this stage it's just myself, however I would definitely be open to contributions :)
